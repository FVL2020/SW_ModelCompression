# SW_ModelCompression

This is the Pytorch implementation for "[A general model compression method for image restoration network](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.image.2021.116134)".

### SWConv

### SW-Models

The SW-DnCNN, SW-RCAN and SW-DnCNN-3 are implemented in SWDnCNN.py, SWRCAN.py and SWDnCNN3.py, respectively. The original networks can be replaced by the corresponding ones for retraining and test.
